## What is CDK ? 

The AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) allows you to create reliable, scalable, and cost-effective cloud applications using familiar programming languages like TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Java, C#/.Net, and Go. 

Here are some key benefits:

1)  Use Programming Concepts: 
    Utilize parameters, conditionals, loops, and inheritance to design your system with AWS building blocks.

2) Unified Codebase: 
   Keep your infrastructure, application code, and configuration together, ensuring a complete, deployable system at every stage.

3) Software Engineering Practices: 
   Apply code reviews, unit tests, and source control to make your infrastructure more robust.

4) Resource Integration: Easily connect AWS resources and manage permissions with straightforward APIs.

5) CloudFormation Integration: Import existing CloudFormation templates to manage your resources with CDK.

6) Predictable Deployments: Leverage CloudFormation for reliable and repeatable infrastructure deployments, with automatic rollback on errors.

7) Shareable Patterns: Share infrastructure design patterns within your team or publicly.

This approach simplifies cloud development and enhances collaboration and reliability.
