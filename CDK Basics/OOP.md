1. Classes and Objects:

   Definition of Class and Object:
   A class serves as a template for creating objects, defining their initial state (attributes) and behavior (methods).
   An object is a specific instance created from this class. 

   Example in AWS CDK:

   1) Class Example: A **Stack** class in AWS CDK, which defines a unit of deployment like a container for AWS resources.
     
   2) Object Creation: Demonstrating how to instantiate a **Stack** object in a CDK application.

   ```
   # Class 
   
   export class Stack {
       StackId: String;
       StackName: String;
       StackDescription: String;
       StackOwner: String;
       StackOwnerEmail: String;
       env: String;
       constructor(StackId: String, StackName: String, StackDescription: String, StackOwner: String,    StackOwnerEmail: String, env: String) {
           this.StackId = StackId;
           this.StackName = StackName;
           this.StackDescription = StackDescription;
           this.StackOwner = StackOwner;
           this.StackOwnerEmail = StackOwnerEmail;
           this.env = env;    
       }
       CreateStack() {
           console.log(`Stack ${this.StackName} created successfully`)
           return this.StackName;
       }
   #Object
   const stack = new Stack('1', 'My-First-CDK-Stack', 'Stack1 Description', 'Stack1 Owner', 'Stack1    Owner Email', 'dev');
   console.log(stack.CreateStack());
   }
   ```

3. Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

   Definition and Principles: Introduce OOP as a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects" which can contain data and code. Discuss the four pillars:

    * Encapsulation:

      In OOP, encapsulation involves bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class. This concept is fundamental in AWS CDK. 

      Example:

      ```
      import { Bucket } from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-s3'; 
      const myBucket = new Bucket(this, 'MyBucket', { versioned: true });
      ```

      CDK Constructs:
      
      A construct can represent a single AWS resource, such as an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket. A construct can also be a higher-level abstraction consisting of multiple related AWS resources.

      Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/constructs.html

      Each AWS resource in CDK is represented as a "construct", a class that encapsulates both the properties of the resource (like an S3 bucket's name or an EC2 instance type) and the methods to operate on it (like creating or configuring the resource).

      Analogy: 
      
      Imagine you have a robot that can paint pictures. You don't need to know how the robot works inside; you just need to tell it what to paint. Encapsulation is like this robot. It keeps the complicated stuff hidden inside and only shows what is necessary to use it.


    * Abstraction: 

      Abstraction in OOP means hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. 

      Simplified Cloud Interactions: CDK abstracts away the complex details of cloud resource provisioning. Users define high-level specifications, and CDK handles the underlying cloud formation and resource dependencies.

      Example: 
      
      When using CDK to create a serverless function, you don't need to manually set up IAM roles, event sources, or logging. CDK abstracts these details, allowing you to focus on the function's core logic. 

      ```
      import { Function, Runtime, Code } from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda'; 
        const myFunction = new Function(this, 'MyFunction', 
        { runtime: Runtime.NODEJS_14_X, handler: 'index.handler', 
        code: Code.fromAsset('lambda') })
      ```

      Analogy: 
      
      Think of your TV remote. You don't need to know how the TV works on the inside. You just press buttons (like volume up or change channel) to tell the TV what to do. Abstraction is like the remote; it lets you control things without worrying about the complex details.

    

    * Inheritance:

      Inheritance allows a new class to inherit properties and methods from an existing class. For Resource Class Hierarchy in CDK, common behaviors and properties are defined in base classes, which are then extended by specific resource classes.

      Example: 
      
      The Resource class in CDK is a base class for many AWS resource constructs, providing shared properties and methods. Specific resources like S3 buckets or Lambda functions extend this base class, inheriting common functionalities.

      ```
      import { Resource, Construct } from 'aws-cdk-lib'; 
      class CustomResource extends Resource { }
      ```

      Analogy: 
      
      Inheritance is like family traits. Just like you might inherit your hair color from your parents, a new class (like a baby) can inherit features from an existing class (like a parent). So, if you have a class that's a basic Phone, a Smartphone class can inherit features from the Phone and then add more features, like a camera or internet browsing.


    * Polymorphism:

      Polymorphism, in the context of object-oriented programming, allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This concept enables a function to use objects of different types interchangeably, as long as they adhere to a specified interface or class hierarchy.

      Example:  Animal Sounds

      Imagine you have a program that deals with different types of animals. Each animal makes a different sound. With polymorphism, you can write a function that can handle any animal type and invoke the makeSound method, regardless of the specific animal.

      ```
      class Animal {
         makeSound() {
         console.log("Some sound");
        }
      }

      class Dog extends Animal {
          makeSound() {
              console.log("Bark");
          }
      }
      
      class Cat extends Animal {
          makeSound() {
              console.log("Meow");
          }
      }
      
      function playSound(animal: Animal) {
          animal.makeSound();
      }
      
      const dog = new Dog();
      const cat = new Cat();
      
      playSound(dog); // Outputs: Bark
      playSound(cat); // Outputs: Meow

      ```

      Polymorphism in AWS CDK

      In AWS CDK, polymorphism is used to manage different AWS services in a unified way. Let's take an example of deploying different types of databases using a common interface.

      AWS CDK Example: Database Deployment

      ```

      import { Construct } from 'aws-cdk-lib';
      import { Table, AttributeType } from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-dynamodb';
      import { DatabaseInstance, DatabaseInstanceEngine } from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-rds';
    
      interface IDatabase {
        // Interface for database constructs
      }
    
      class DynamoDbDatabase extends Table implements IDatabase {
          constructor(scope: Construct, id: string) {
              super(scope, id, {
                  partitionKey: { name: 'id', type: AttributeType.STRING }
              });
          }
      }
      
      class RdsDatabase extends DatabaseInstance implements IDatabase {
          constructor(scope: Construct, id: string) {
              super(scope, id, {
                  engine: DatabaseInstanceEngine.MYSQL,
                  // Other configuration...
              });
          }
      }
      
      function deployDatabase(database: IDatabase) {
          // Function to deploy any database type
      }
      
      const dynamoDb = new DynamoDbDatabase(/* ... */);
      const rdsDb = new RdsDatabase(/* ... */);
      
      deployDatabase(dynamoDb);
      deployDatabase(rdsDb);
      ```
   
      In this AWS CDK example:
  
      * IDatabase is an interface representing a generic database.
      * DynamoDbDatabase and RdsDatabase are classes that implement this interface, representing    specific database types.
      * The deployDatabase function can handle any database object that implements IDatabase, showcasing    polymorphism.
  
      Through these examples, you can see how polymorphism allows for flexibility and reusability in    code, enabling the same function to work with objects of different classes as long as they adhere    to a common interface or class structure. This principle is a cornerstone of efficient and    scalable object-oriented design.



4. Constructors and the super Method

   * Purpose of Constructors: Constructors are special methods invoked at the time of creating an  object. They are used to initialize the object's properties.
   
   * Using super in AWS CDK: In CDK, when extending classes, super is used to call the constructor of a base class. This is crucial in inheritance.

   ```
   class ParentClass {
       constructor() {
           console.log('Parent constructor called');
       }
   }
   
   class ChildClass extends ParentClass {
       constructor() {
           console.log('Child constructor called');
           super(); // Calling the parent class constructor
       }
   }
   
   const childObject = new ChildClass();
   ```

   In the above Code: 
   
   * ParentClass has a constructor that prints a message when it's called.
   * ChildClass extends ParentClass. Its constructor first prints its own message and then calls super (), which invokes the constructor of ParentClass.
   * When creating a new instance of ChildClass, both messages are printed, demonstrating the order of constructor calls.

5. Interfaces and Their Usage in AWS CDK

   * Interface Definition: An interface is a contract that defines a set of methods a class must    implement, without specifying how these methods should be implemented.

   * Interfaces in AWS CDK:  In CDK, interfaces are used to define standard behaviors for constructs. Next, let's demonstrate the use of an interface in TypeScript, especially in the context of AWS CDK. Suppose we have an interface for a service configuration.
 
   ```
   interface ServiceConfig {
       serviceName: string;
       servicePort: number;
   }
   
   class MyServiceStack extends Stack {
       private config: ServiceConfig;
   
       constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, config: ServiceConfig, props?: StackProps) {
           super(scope, id, props);
           this.config = config;
           // Use config to set up service-specific resources
       }
   }
   
   // Usage
   const serviceConfig: ServiceConfig = {
       serviceName: 'MyService',
       servicePort: 8080
   };
   
   const myServiceStack = new MyServiceStack(app, 'MyServiceStack', serviceConfig, {
       // Stack properties
   });
   ```

   In this example,  ServiceConfig is an interface that defines the shape of the service configuration. MyServiceStack is a CDK stack class that takes a ServiceConfig object as a parameter. This demonstrates how interfaces can be used to enforce certain structures in your classes.
